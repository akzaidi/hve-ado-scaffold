# GitHub Copilot for Data Science

## Copilot Instructions (.github/instructions) what guides Copilot

* [instructions/uv-projects.instructions.md](.github/instructions/uv-projects.instructions.md) - Instructions for managing Python environments with uv. Handles project initialization, dependency management, and CUDA detection for ML workflows.

## Copilot Prompts

* [prompts/uv-manage.prompt.md](.github/prompts/uv-manage.prompt.md) - Prompt for creating and managing uv projects

## Copilot Agent Modes (.github/agents) for workflow automation

Located in [`.github/agents/`](./.github/agents/). Specialized persistent personas for data science workflows:

* [`gen-data-spec.agent.md`](./.github/agents/gen-data-spec.agent.md) - Systematic data discovery and content review. Analyzes directory structures, previews data formats, and creates exploration plans in `docs/notes/`.
* [`gen-jupyter-notebook.agent.md`](./.github/agents/gen-jupyter-notebook.agent.md) - Exploratory data analysis notebook creation. Generates comprehensive EDA notebooks with summary statistics, visualizations, and data transforms using pandas, seaborn, and plotly.
* [`gen-streamlit-dashboard.agent.md`](./.github/agents/gen-streamlit-dashboard.agent.md) - Multi-page Streamlit dashboard development. Creates interactive data exploration apps with univariate/multivariate analysis, time series visualization, and optional AutoGen chat integration.
* [`test-streamlit-dashboard.agent.md`](./.github/agents/test-streamlit-dashboard.agent.md) - Automated functional and behavioral testing for Streamlit dashboards. Uses Playwright and the VS Code Simple Browser extension to interact with the app, validate UI flows, and ensure dashboard reliability.

Why agents? They reduce drift: each mode enforces domain‑specific rigor and artifacts. For data science, they create a structured workflow from data discovery → environment setup → exploration → dashboard deployment.

## Labs

These hands-on labs demonstrate the complete data science workflow using GitHub Copilot Agents, from environment setup through interactive dashboard deployment and testing.

### Lab 0: Python Environment Setup with uv

#### Objective

Establish a reproducible Python development environment using uv for modern dependency management, optimized for data science workflows.

   * Automatically generates `pyproject.toml` with project metadata
   * Creates or updates `.venv` virtual environment directory

3. **Install Core Data Science Dependencies**
   * Copilot automatically adds essential packages:
     * `ipykernel` and `ipywidgets` for Jupyter notebook support
     * `black` for code formatting
     * `tqdm` for progress bars
     * `pytest` for testing
   * Additional packages will be added based on your data requirements

4. **Environment Activation and Validation**
